# calculator-project
* Overview:
This project is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

* Features:
 1. Addition (+)
 2. Subtraction (-)
 3. Multiplication (*)
 4. Division (/)
 5. Modulus (%)
    
 * User Interface :
 1. In this project, I created a user-friendly interface for a calculator. 
 2. The layout design includes a display for input and results. 
 3. The project features buttons for digits (0-9), decimal points, and operators (+, -, *, /, %). 
 4. Additionally, special buttons such as "equals" (=) and "clear" (‚Üê) have been added for enhanced 
    functionality.
    
 * Functionality :
 1. I implemented the core functionality using JavaScript by defining functions to handle calculations.
 2. The user can enter numeric values, perform operations, and obtain accurate results.
 3. The script ensures proper execution of arithmetic operations while handling user inputs efficient.

 * Operations :
 1. The calculator is capable of performing basic arithmetic operations, including addition,subtraction, multiplication, division, and 
    modulus. 
 2. It features an "equals" button to display results and a "clear" button to reset calculations. 
 3. I ensured that the calculator follows the correct order of operations using the BODMAS/BIDMAS rule for accurate computations.

 * Input Handling : 
 1. The calculator accurately handles user input and responds to button clicks for every operation. 
 2. Each button functions correctly, displaying accurate results based on its assigned operation.
    
 * Error Handling :
  I implemented error handling to manage cases like division by zero and other mathematical errors, ensuring the calculator provides 
  appropriate alerts or messages instead of incorrect results.

 * Extra Challenges
 I enhanced the calculator with features like modulus, decimal point support, and percentage calculations, ensuring more comprehensive 
 functionality for users
